if you're hacking at zebra, PLEASE send patches against the latest SVN!
to get zebra from SVN (if you haven't already), run:

    svn co https://zebra.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/zebra/trunk zebra
    cd zebra
    autoreconf --install

this will generate configure and all that other foo you usually get with
a release.  you will need to have some basic "developer tools" installed
in order for this to work (particularly GNU autotools)

when you're done hacking and want to make your patch, run:

    svn diff > hacked.patch

and go post this file in the patches section off the project page:

    https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=189236&atid=928517
