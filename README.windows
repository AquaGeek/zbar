ZBAR BAR CODE READER
====================

The ZBar Bar Code Reader is a library for scanning and decoding bar
codes from various sources such as video streams, image files or raw
intensity sensors.  It supports EAN/UPC, Code 128, Code 39 and
Interleaved 2 of 5.  Included with the library are basic applications
for decoding captured bar code images and using a video device (eg,
webcam) as a bar code scanner.  The flexible, layered architecture
features a fast, streaming interface with a minimal memory footprint.

INSTALLING
==========

The zbarimg program uses ImageMagick to read image files.  You will
need at least ImageMagick version 6.2.6 if you want to scan image
files.  ImageMagick may be obtained from
    http://www.imagemagick.org/

Download and install the current Windows binary release, making sure
that you select the *Dynamic* (DLL) version, eg:
    ImageMagick-x.y.z-w-Q16-windows-dll.exe

You will also want the "Update executable search path" box checked
during installation.


RUNNING
=======

This version of the package includes *only command line programs*.
(The graphical interface is scheduled for a future release)

Invoke Start -> Programs -> ZBar Bar Code Reader -> Start ZBar Command Prompt
to open a shell that has the zbarimg command available (in the PATH).

To decode an image file, type:
    zbarimg "C:\path\to\barcode.png"

For basic command instructions, type:
    zbarimg --help

Check the manual for more details.
