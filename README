ZEBRA BARCODE READER
====================

Zebra is a layered barcode (EAN/UPC) scanning and decoding library.
It includes application front ends for decoding captured bar code
images and using a video device (eg, webcam) as a bar code scanner.
The library features a fast streaming interface with a minimal memory
footprint

Check the Zebra home page for the latest release, mailing lists, etc.

License information can be found in 'COPYING.LIB'.


BUILDING
========

See 'INSTALL' for generic configuration and build instructions.

The scanner/decoder library itself only requires a few standard
library functions which should be avilable almost anywhere (and if
they're not, you probably already know how to mock something up)

The zebraimg program uses ImageMagick to read image files, you can
obtain it from
    http://www.imagemagick.org/

The zebracam program uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) to
display video.  SDL is available from
    http://www.libsdl.org/

zebracam also uses the video4linux API (v4l1) to access the video
device.  This interface is part of the kernel.  More information is
available at
    http://linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/

If required libraries are not available the corresponding program will
not be built.


RUNNING
=======

'make install' will install the library and application programs.  Run
'zebracam' to start the video scanner.  use 'zebraimg barcode.jpg' to
decode a saved image file.
