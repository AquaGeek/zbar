ZEBRA BARCODE READER
====================

Zebra is a layered barcode (EAN/UPC/Code 128) scanning and decoding
library. It includes application front ends for decoding captured bar
code images and using a video device (eg, webcam) as a bar code
scanner.  The library features a fast streaming interface with a
minimal memory footprint

Check the zebra library home page for the latest release, mailing
lists, etc.

License information can be found in 'COPYING.LIB'.


BUILDING
========

See 'INSTALL' for generic configuration and build instructions.

The scanner/decoder library itself only requires a few standard
library functions which should be avilable almost anywhere.

The zebraimg program uses ImageMagick to read image files in many
different formats, you can obtain it from
    http://www.imagemagick.org/

The zebracam program uses the video4linux API (v4l1) to access the
video device.  This interface is part of the linux kernel.  More
information is available at
    http://linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/

If required libraries are not available you may disable building for
the corresponding program using configure (see configure --help).


RUNNING
=======

'make install' will install the library and application programs.  Run
'zebracam' to start the video scanner.  use 'zebraimg barcode.jpg' to
decode a saved image file.


REPORTING BUGS
==============

Bugs can be reported on the sourceforge project page

Please include the zebra version number and a detailed description of
the problem.  You'll probably have better luck if you're also familiar
